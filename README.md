An introduction to Programming using Linux Assembly Language

Inspired by my desire to understand computer architecture, I have started reading and practicing assembly language in my leisure time. I love the book *Programming From The Ground Up* by Jonathan Bartlett. After going through the first chapter, you quickly learn to narrow the scope of curiosity since Computer Science is vast.

`There is somewhat of a chichen and egg problem in teaching programming, especially assembly language. There is a lot to learn, and it is almost necessary to learn it all at once. However, each piece depends on all the others, which makes learning it piece difficult. Therefore, you must be patience with yourself and the computer while learning to program.`

One of the greatest programmers, Donald Knuth, describes programming not as telling a computer how to do something, but as telling a person how they would instruct a computer to do something.

A few books that Im using for these repository, this also includes Intel Architecture Manual.
