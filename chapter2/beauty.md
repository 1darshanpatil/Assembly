# Machine Code
To see the machine code, i.e., the actual bytes that represent the assembled and linked program, you can use a tool like `objdump`. This tool is commonly available on Unix-like systems, including Linux, and can disassemble the binary to show you the machine code instructions.

**Assemble and Link You Program**
```bash
as exit.s -o exit.o
ld exit.o -o exit
```

**Use `objdump` to Disassemble the Binary:**
```bash
objdump -d exit
```
This command will disassemble the `exit` binary and show you the machine code along with the corresponding assembly instructions. The `-d` option tells `objdump` to disassemble the executable section of the binary.

**Inspect the Output**
Output as below:

```

exit:     file format elf64-x86-64


Disassembly of section .text:

0000000000401000 <_start>:
  401000:	b8 01 00 00 00       	mov    $0x1,%eax
  401005:	bb 00 00 00 00       	mov    $0x0,%ebx
  40100a:	cd 80                	int    $0x80
```
In this case, `401000` is the address for the machine instruction `b8 01 00 00 00` for the instruction `mov    $0x1,%eax`

## Explanation
 * **Machine Code:** The hex bytes (b8 01 00 00 00 ) are the actual machine code instructions that CPU executes.

* **Assembly Instructions:** The corresponding assembly code (e.g., `mov $0x3c, %eax`) is a human-readable representation of the machine code.

## Additional Tools
* **hexdump:** If you want to see the raw bytes of the binary file, you can see `hexdump` 

```bash
hexdump -C exit
```
```bash

This will show you a hex dump of the entire file, not just the executable sections.


* **readlf:** To see more detailed information about the binary, you can see `readlf`
```bash
readlf -a exit
```

These tools will give you a comprehensive view of the machine code and the structure of your binary file.
